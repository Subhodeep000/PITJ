        On a fine spring morning, Pratyush opened his eyes and saw many monkeys around him.
        <center>FEW DAYS AGO</center>
        Alarm clock rings: cring cring!!!.
        Pratyush wake up and entered into the bathroom. Suddenly he realised "O how can i forget this, today I have to go in 
        the yacht trip". He then realished that he was getting late.
        So he hurried up and packed his bag as quickly as possible. After completing his lunch, he went for the trip.
         The tripis of 5 days and 5 nights and he was very excited for it. He was so much excited that forgot to wear his pants.
        If his mother hadn't aware about it, he would have left without wearing pants. At last he reached the yacht. H enjoyed the night view 
        and he heavily enjoyed the next day in the yacht. But the weather condition continued to get worse from the afternoon. And with in few hours 
        the condition was getting worst and finally a the yacht hit with a Tornadic waterspouts. The yacht was wreched, some how Pratyush managed to get out 
        of that situation but at that moment he was not understanding what he would do. He was in water and thinking in his mind "What i will do now, i don`t even have the mobile to contact with family".
        He was swimming in the water for 1 day and he saw a small boat. He took that and float with that for 2 long days. He was hungry as well as he became very weak. Even he doesnot have the energy to 
        to float with the boat and he finally became senseless. On the other hand Pratyush`s parents heard the news of yecht wreched. They started to find him. His mother was so worried about him 
        that she always praying about him in front of God.
        <p>When he opened his eyes he saw many monkeys were staning around him.</p>
